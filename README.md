The Interactive Quiz Application is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective of this project is to provide a simple, user-friendly platform for conducting multiple-choice quizzes and evaluating user knowledge in an interactive manner. This application can be used in educational institutions, online learning platforms, and self-assessment systems.

The structure of the project is divided into three main components: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality and interactivity. HTML is used to create the basic layout of the quiz interface, including the question area, multiple-choice options, and navigation buttons. CSS enhances the visual appearance of the application by providing a clean layout, background color, proper spacing, rounded borders, and hover effects for buttons. This makes the quiz interface visually appealing and easy to use.

JavaScript plays a crucial role in making the quiz interactive. The quiz questions are stored in a JavaScript array as objects, where each object contains a question, four answer options, and the correct answer. This approach makes the application dynamic and scalable, as new questions can be added easily without changing the core logic of the program.

When the quiz starts, the application loads the first question dynamically using JavaScript. Users can select one answer option using radio buttons and move to the next question by clicking the “Next” button. The application validates whether an option is selected before proceeding, ensuring proper user input. Once the user selects an answer, the program compares it with the correct answer stored in the quiz data and updates the score accordingly.

The application keeps track of the current question index and the user’s score using JavaScript variables. After the user answers all questions, the quiz ends, and the final score is displayed on the screen. This immediate feedback helps users evaluate their performance and understand their level of knowledge.

One of the key advantages of this project is its simplicity and efficiency. It does not require any external libraries, databases, or backend servers, making it lightweight and easy to deploy. The project can be executed on any modern web browser without additional setup. Despite its simplicity, the application demonstrates important web development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, and data storage using JavaScript objects and arrays.

This Interactive Quiz Application can be further enhanced by adding advanced features such as a timer, difficulty levels, result analysis, user authentication, or database integration. Overall, this project serves as an excellent beginner-to-intermediate level web development project and provides a strong foundation for understanding interactive web applications.
